BUILDING THE BIND SERVER
========================

The driver module and header file (mysqldb.c and mysqldb.h) must be copied to (or linked into) the bind9/bin/named and bind9/bin/named/include directories respectively, 

In File bin/named/Makefile.in
set DBDRIVER_OBJS = mysqldb.@O@
set DBDRIVER_SRCS = mysqldb.c

Add the results from the command mysql_config --cflags to DBDRIVER_INCLUDES.
(e.g. DBDRIVER_INCLUDES = -I'/usr/include/mysql')

Add the results from the command mysql_config --libs to DBRIVER_LIBS.
(e.g. DBDRIVER_LIBS = -L'/usr/lib/mysql' -lmysqlclient -lz -lcrypt -lnsl -lm -lc -lnss_files -lnss_dns -lresolv -lc -lnss_files -lnss_dns -lresolv)

In bind9/bin/named/main.c, add an include to mysqldb.h (e.g. #include "mysqldb.h") Then you must register the driver in setup(), by adding mysqldb_init(); before the call to ns_server_create().

Unregistration should be in cleanup(), by adding the call mysqldb_clear(); after the call to ns_server_destroy().

./configure
make
make install

You should read the README file with the BIND distribution for more options to pass to configure. You may also want to read the document sdb in the bind doc/misc/ directory.

Note: with this latest version of mysql-bind, I have added domain_id and tenant_id. This is to facilitate a means for domains to be owned by some manner of user. This works out of the box with Moniker, but you can use the same scheme. tenant_id can be any unique character per user, domain_id can be unique per domain.

EXAMPLE ENTRY IN NAMED.CONF
===========================

zone "mydomain.com" {
  type master;
  notify no;
  database "mysqldb dbname dns_domains hostname user password domain_id tenant_id";
};

In the first line, change the zone to match your domain. In the database line, dbname is the name of the MySQL database, tablename is the name of the table for this domain/zone, hostname is the name of the database host, user and password are for access to the database.

DATABASE SCHEMA
===============

You should create a database for the driver and create the table for the domains you wish to serve. The SQL file in sql/dns_domains_create.sql will create this table named as "dns_domains", though the name is arbitrary. Note: originally, there was a table for each zone, but this would scale poorly with MySQL and a better design pattern is to use a single table albeit with partitions. 



EXAMPLE DATABASE DATA
=====================

The file sql/dns_domains_data.sql create test data you can use to familiarize yourself with the setup.
